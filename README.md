# Classification-on-heart-disease

This project focuses on predicting the presence of heart disease in patients using three different machine learning algorithms: Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Random Forest, and Logistic Regression. The primary goal is to develop a robust model that can accurately classify patients based on their medical attributes.
